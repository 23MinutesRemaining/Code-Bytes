# Code-Bytes
Bites of code that I've learned and want to share with the world!

Welcome to Code-Bytes,
In this repository I will upload snippets of code that I have learned throughout python courses.
In addition to the code snippets, I also provide my personal thoughts and way of understanding each method/algorithm

Note: This is a personal project with intent to learn git-hub and share my scode snippets Ihave learned. Hello GitHub! and Thank You!
